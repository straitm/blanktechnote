# From the manual: "Usually when a command fails, if it has changed
# the target file at all, the file is corrupted and cannot be used--or
# at least it is not completely updated. Yet the file's timestamp says
# that it is now up to date, so the next time make runs, it will not
# try to update that file. The situation is just the same as when the
# command is killed by a signal; see section Interrupting or Killing
# make. So generally the right thing to do is to delete the target file
# if the command fails after beginning to change the file. make will do
# this if .DELETE_ON_ERROR appears as a target. This is almost always
# what you want make to do, but it is not historical practice; so for
# compatibility, you must explicitly request it."
